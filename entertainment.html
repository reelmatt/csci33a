                    <h3>My Experience</h3>
                    <p>From a very young age, one of my favorite things to do was not just watch movies and television, but to specifically watch all of the bonus features and behind-the-scenes videos that came <i>with</i> the movie. Watching people make movies was just so fascinating to me and I became determined to make films of my own.</p>
                    <p>Starting with an English project freshman year of high school, I got more deeply involved in all things video production. From countless high school projects, I applied to film school and attended Emerson College. Four years later, and even more videos under my belt, I graduated with my undergraduate degree in Film Editing, and now use that in my day job editing educational videos.</p>

                    <h3>Favorite entertainment</h3>
                    <p>The way I see it, in order to be a good filmmaker you need to enjoy movies. I'll watch pretty much any genre of movie or television, and try to appreciate what each is trying to accomplish. Taking inspiration from <a href="http://honkysmovieyear.blogspot.com">Honky's Movie Year blog</a>, which I heard of on a podcast, I ventured on a movie year of my own starting in 2012. While I haven't kept up as well as Honky has, I did succeed in watching 365 films in 365 days my first year. Some movies were great, some were bad, all I rated and reviewed on my own blog.</p>
                    <p>To get a brief sense of some of my favorite movies and television shows, check out the lists for a semi-random assortment. To check-out a list of all my five-star rated films, you can <a href="https://letterboxd.com/reelmatt/films/ratings/rated/5/">see that on Letterboxd</a> (unfortunately, I don't have a similar service for tracking TV shows).</p>
