                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Computers were also a big thing for me growing up, but programming was challenging. It seemed fun because my dad does it, but despite my best efforts, writing code never really clicked for me. It wasn't until after I <a href="./entertainment.html">graduated college with my degree in Film Editing</a> and started work that I got into writing code and computer science.</p>
                <p>It started really simply and mostly be accident. I needed to do something in an Excel document and the tutorial I Googled described how to use the IF() formula. Having dabbled in programming before, I knew if/else was a main logic construct that was used and as I did more and more with Excel formulas, I decided to venture out and take an actual computer course.</p>
                <p>After a few years now, I'm well on my way towards a graduate degree in software engineering from the Harvard Extension school. CSCI s33a is just the latest course, and one of a couple web classes I've taken so far.</p>
